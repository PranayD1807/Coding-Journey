# Developer Learning Path

This repository documents my structured approach to enhancing my skills across core programming topics, full-stack development, and competitive programming.

## Sections

### 1. Core Programming Foundations

- **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)**: A deep dive into essential DSA concepts and problem-solving skills.

### 2. Computer Science Fundamentals

- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: Understanding OOP principles and design patterns.
- **Operating Systems (OS)**: Key OS concepts like memory management, process scheduling, and file systems.
- **Database Management Systems (DBMS)**: Database fundamentals, SQL, indexing, and optimization techniques.

### 3. Full Stack and Advanced Development

- **MERN Stack Revision**: Refresh knowledge of MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js.
- **System Design**: Explore architectural patterns, scalability, load balancing, and distributed systems.
- **JavaScript Essentials**: A focused review on JavaScript fundamentals and best practices.
- **New Tech Stack**: Introduction to Java, Spring Boot, and Kotlin for backend development.

### 4. Competitive Programming Practice

- **Coding Contests**: Practice coding on platforms like CodeChef, Codeforces, and LeetCode.

## Goals

1. **Master Core CS Concepts**: Build a strong foundation in core areas for a deeper understanding of computing.
2. **Full Stack Proficiency**: Solidify expertise in the MERN stack while exploring new backend technologies.
3. **Competitive Edge**: Improve problem-solving speed and accuracy through regular contests.
