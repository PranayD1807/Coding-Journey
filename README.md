# Developer Learning Path

This repository documents my structured approach to enhancing my skills across core programming topics, full-stack development, and competitive programming.

## Sections

### 1. Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)

- **Concepts**: A deep dive into essential DSA concepts.
- **Problems**: Questions & Solutions with key takeaway

### 2. Computer Science Fundamentals

- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: Understanding OOP principles and design patterns.
- **Operating Systems (OS)**: Key OS concepts like memory management, process scheduling, and file systems.
- **Database Management Systems (DBMS)**: Database fundamentals, SQL, indexing, and optimization techniques.

### 3. Full Stack and Advanced Development

- **MERN Stack Revision**: Refresh knowledge of MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js.
- **System Design**: Explore architectural patterns, scalability, load balancing, and distributed systems.
- **JavaScript Essentials**: A focused review on JavaScript fundamentals and best practices.
- **New Tech Stack**: Introduction to Java, Spring Boot, and Kotlin for backend development.

### 4. Competitive Programming Practice

- **Coding Contests**: Practice coding on platforms like CodeChef, Codeforces, and LeetCode.
